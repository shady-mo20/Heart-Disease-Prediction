# **Heart Disease Prediction**

This project aims to develop a predictive model to assess the likelihood of heart disease in patients using **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**. The dataset contains medical records with key health indicators. The project includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, data visualization, and model training to make accurate predictions.
